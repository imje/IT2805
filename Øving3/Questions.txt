1. What is the difference between position: absolute and position: fixed ? 
Position: fixed is used when you want an element to stay in the same place of the screen all the time, even during scrolling.
Position: absolute is used when you want the element to be relative to another positioned element (an anchestor). If the element does not have a positioned ancestor, the elemtent moves along whit the screen during scrolling.
2. With CSS3, how do we access the third element within another element? 
To access the third element within another element we can use the selector nth-child(3). An example is if we want ta access the third element in a list: ul li:nth-child(3).
